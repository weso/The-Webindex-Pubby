# The Webindex Pubby

## What is The Web Index? ##
The [Webindex](http://thewebindex.org/ "Go to the Webindex Page") is a unique annual ranking of countries on the progress and social utility of the Web. Combining over 80 indicators to evaluate access, affordability, institutional and policy environment and social and economic utility, it will provide an evidence-based tool for national and regional advocacy, intervention, and strategy to strengthen the Web. The 2012 Web Index was published on September 5, 2012.

## What can "The Webindex Pubby" do?
The Webindex Pubby is an adaptation of [Pubby - A Linked Data Frontend for SPARQL Endpoints](http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/pubby/ "Go to the pubby's website"), to be used to display in a more friendly way, the information of the countries analysed by the WebIndex.

## How It Works? ##
Just as any maven project, build it and deploy it in your favourite servlet container's webapps folder. For better performance, you will need a [Memcached](http://memcached.org/ "Go to memcached.org") server listening.
